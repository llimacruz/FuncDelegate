# FuncDelegate
These few lines of code bring samples of c# func delegates.

There are the following cases:
* using external function
* using external function with parameters
* using anonymous method
* using anonymous method with lambda
* using anonymous method with lambda in line
* using anonymous method with lambda and a little bit more
* using anonymous method with lambda and a little bit more in line

I hope it will be useful.
